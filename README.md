I am currently working on Guardians of Adelia which is a Dungeon Driven Minecraft MMORPG server. <br/>
https://www.guardiansofadelia.com/ <br/>
Guardians of Adelia have 3 repositories: [Minecraft plugin](https://github.com/Lix3nn53/GuardiansOfAdelia), [Svelte app](https://github.com/Lix3nn53/goa-svelte) and [Go rest-api](https://github.com/Lix3nn53/goa-golang).
